A minimalist, beautiful, and responsive **habit tracking app** built with **SwiftUI** and **SwiftData**. This project is part of the [#100DaysOfSwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) challenge (Day 47), and is designed to showcase my growing expertise in modern iOS development.

## 📱 Features

- ✅ **Habit Logging:** Create and manage personal habits with emoji, title, and descriptions.
- ✅ **Completion Calendar:** Track your habit completion on a monthly calendar view with subtle animations and haptic feedback.
- ✅ **Completion Highlighting:** Completed habits are automatically grayed out and moved to the bottom until the day resets.
- ✅ **Dark Mode Support:** Fully supports system appearance for seamless transitions.
- ✅ **Dynamic Type Ready:** Adapts beautifully to the user’s preferred text size for accessibility.
- ✅ **Data Persistence:** Uses **SwiftData**’s `@Model` and `@Query` for clean, native data modeling and querying.
- ✅ **NavigationStack:** Modern navigation with type-safe detail views.
- ✅ **Preview-Ready:** Uses `.modelContainer(inMemory:)` for smooth and realistic SwiftUI Previews.
- ✅ **Filter Controls (Upcoming):** UI space and logic reserved for filtering and sorting habits (e.g. by category or status).

|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `SwiftUI`        | Declarative UI framework              |
| `SwiftData`      | Modern persistence with `@Model`      |
| `NavigationStack`| Navigation system with type safety    |
| `@Environment`   | Contextual data handling              |

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project gave me hands-on experience with:

- Structuring a SwiftUI app using `@Model` with SwiftData.
- Building UI with adaptive layout and animations.
- Integrating haptic feedback to enhance UX.
- Organizing logic using the MVC pattern.
- Handling calendar state, streak logic, and disabled future dates.

## 💼 About Me

I’m currently building my portfolio as I transition into iOS development. This app represents my practical application of SwiftUI and SwiftData as I continue learning through the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) curriculum.
